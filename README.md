<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Over the course of COVID, online brokers have seen a spike of new investors and traders. 
New investors and traders may not have the knowledge and background to understand the latest news sentiments. 
We hope to use ML to help classify current news sentiment and help predict the trend of a stock.
In this project, we use different machine learning models to predict stock headline's sentiment and in hope to find a relationship between the headline sentiments and stock price movement.
Given a financial news headline, predict the financial news headline sentiment and output: -1 (negative) or 1 (positive)
