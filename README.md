<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Over the course of COVID, online brokers have seen a spike of new investors and traders. 
New investors and traders may not have the knowledge and background to understand the latest news sentiments. 
We hope to use ML to help classify current news sentiment and help predict the trend of a stock.
In this project, we use different machine learning models to predict stock headline's sentiment and in hope to find a relationship between the headline sentiments and stock price movement.
Given a financial news headline, predict the financial news headline sentiment and output: -1 (negative) or 1 (positive) 


## Folders explained
* data analysis - This folder includes a script that compared sentiments to price movement.

* datasets - This folder includes the dataset used for some models.

* models - This folder includes all the models that we have built and tested for this task (and requiremets to run). *note: to run each model in models, refer to the comments in script.

* pre-processing - This folder includes pre-processing steps for some models and before training data anlysis.

* final_model -This folder includes our final model that had the best performance among all the models. This file should contain all that you need to perform our best prediction.
